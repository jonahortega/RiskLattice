# Final Fix - Using Compact Output Size

The issue was that `outputsize=full` is also a premium feature! I've changed it to `outputsize=compact` which is FREE and gives you the last 100 data points (about 3-4 months of data), which is perfect for our 90-day analysis.

## What I Fixed:

Changed from `outputsize=full` to `outputsize=compact` - this is the free tier option.

## Now Try:

1. **Click "Refresh All" button** in your browser
2. **Wait 30-60 seconds**
3. **You should see live data!** 🎉

Docker should auto-reload the changes. The free tier gives you 100 days of data which is perfect for our use case!
