# Simple Start - Run Without Docker

Since Docker is having network issues, let's run it directly:

## Step 1: Start Frontend Only (Easiest)

Open Terminal and run:

```bash
cd /Users/jonahortega/risklattice/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Wait 1-2 minutes for npm install, then you'll see:
```
➜  Local:   http://localhost:5173/
```

**Open that URL in your browser!**

Note: The frontend will load but won't have data until backend is running. But at least you can see the interface!
