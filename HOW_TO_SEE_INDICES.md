# How to See NASDAQ, Dow Jones, and S&P 500

## To See the Indices with Data:

The indices need to be added to your watchlist first, then refreshed to get their data.

### Steps:

1. **Go to "My Watchlist"** (or Dashboard)

2. **Add these tickers to your watchlist**:
   - `^IXIC` (NASDAQ Composite)
   - `^DJI` (Dow Jones Industrial Average)  
   - `^GSPC` (S&P 500 Index)

3. **Click "Refresh All"** button

4. **Go back to Home page** - The indices should now appear first with their data!

## Note:

The indices use the `^` symbol (like `^IXIC`). Make sure to include the `^` when adding them to your watchlist.

Once they're in your watchlist and refreshed, they'll show up on the home page first (since they're at the beginning of the list) with their custom images and data!
