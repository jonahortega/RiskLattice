# Fixed: Back to Reliable Version (No "Loading...")

## What I Changed:

Reverted back to only showing stocks WITH cached data. This removes the "Loading..." problem.

## Current Behavior:

- **Only shows stocks with cached data** (no "Loading..." messages)
- **Indices are in the list** - they'll appear FIRST when they have data
- **To see indices**: Add them to watchlist, click "Refresh All"
- **Reliable**: No errors, no "Loading..." problems

## Result:

- Stocks that were working before: Still working ✅
- No "Loading..." messages: Fixed ✅
- Indices: Will appear first when you add them to watchlist ✅

The reliable version is restored!
