# Debug Steps - Data Not Loading

Let's check what's happening. Please check your backend terminal for errors.

## Quick Checks:

1. **Check Backend Terminal** - Do you see any error messages in red?
   - Look for things like "Connection refused", "Database", "yfinance", or "Error"

2. **Is Database Running?**
   - If you're running backend locally but database is in Docker, you need Docker running for the database
   - Or we can switch to a local database

Please share what errors you see in the backend terminal!
